# Mongo docker image for ARM

This docker image has been made after problems with the fact running arm64v8 Mongo docker image on Raspberry 3 with ubuntu server 22.04 64bit. So if you have a similar problem I hope I have resolved your problem ;)

## Build

Firstly download the dockerfile and one time this is done do this command:

```sh
sudo docker build -t <name> .
```

In case of problems open a PR.
